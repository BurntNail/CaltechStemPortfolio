# Caltech Stem Portfolio

Common App ID: 36414644

These are the three projects that I'm currently most proud of, collated here for my Caltech Application. I've deliberately used git submodules over copying in the files manually to ensure the git history is clearly preserved. Github should mark force pushes (although I haven't tested this) so you can verify I haven't done anything to make the git history strange or changed the commit details recently.

If I've misinterpreted the `Coding Projects` item from the submission site and you only intended to evaluate one project, my preference is for you to look at the `souris` project.

Development will likely continue as these are all active projects, but if you would like to see the projects as they were on the day of submission, please see these links to the specific commit file trees:
